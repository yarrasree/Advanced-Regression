# Advanced-Regression
Australia Housing Price Prediction using Advanced Regression (Lasso and Ridge techniques)

<b>Business Goal<b>:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
Steps we will follow in this assignment as follow:
1. Reading, understanding and visualising the data
2. Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split etc)
3. Model building and evaluation
